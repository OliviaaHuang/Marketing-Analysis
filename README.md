This is precisely how analytics-enablement can help any marketing function to maximum business revenue and optimize their marketing funnel by smartly allocating their funds, at scale.

    Dataset_90Percent.xlsx is dataset for marketer to make market plans by using Logistics Regression Model.
This data contains 4940 records with 11 columns.
